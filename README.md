Now I've been writing Haskell for a while, I figure it's time to start reading
a lot of the "fundamental" papers, and see if I can fill in some of the gaps.

This repository is a collection of notes for papers that I've read. These notes
will most likely take the form of Haskell code, but we'll see what happens.
